# 👋 Hello, world! I'm José Raeiro

🎯 **Cybersecurity Engineer** | 🛡️ SOC Automation Specialist | 🐚 Scripter of Systems | 🩻 Pentester-in-Progress

---

🔍 I’m driven by a deep curiosity for how systems break — and how they can be defended.  
🛠️ By day, I automate defenses and improve detection capabilities at the SOC.  
🧠 By night, I break things (ethically!) to better understand attacker logic and offensive tooling.

---

### 💼 What I’m working on

- Red-teaming skills with a focus on **Active Directory**, **privilege escalation**, and **lateral movement**  
- Building use cases and detections for **Wazuh**, **CrowdStrike**, and **FortiSIEM**
- Automating workflows with **Python**, **Bash**, and **PowerShell**

---

### 🎯 Looking to collaborate on:

- Offensive security tools and scripts  
- Wazuh integrations and detection logic  
- Anything that mixes **creativity + cybersecurity**
